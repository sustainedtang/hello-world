I'm beginning my journey into learning how to program. My journey is unique, from birth, but it is not unique in the transition from chef, linecook to programmer. There are more talented chefs than I who have made the pivot into this direction, an older ages than I. Reaffirming that even greater cooks have walked away from the kitchen to pursue something larger.
